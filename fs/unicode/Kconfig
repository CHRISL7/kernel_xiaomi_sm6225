	  Say Y here to enable UTF-8 NFD normalization and NFD+CF casefolding
	  support.

	default UNICODE
	help
	  This contains a large table of case foldings, which can be loaded as
	  a separate module if you say M here.  To be on the safe side stick
	  to the default of Y.  Saying N here makes no sense, if you do not want
	  utf8 casefolding support, disable CONFIG_UNICODE instead.
